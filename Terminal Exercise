10. What is a flag? Give three examples of flags you have used.
11. What do the ***r*** and ***f*** flags do with the ***rm*** command?

### Solution

## **Part I**

- make a directory called first **mkdir first**
- change directory to the first folder **cd first**
- create a file called person.txt **touch person.txt**
- change the name of the file to another.txt **mv person.txt another.txt**
- make a copy of the another.txt file and call it copy.txt **cp another.txt copy.txt**
- remove the copy.txt file **rm copy.txt**
- make a copy of the first folder and call it second **cp -r first second**
- delete the second folder **rm -rf second**

## **Part II**

- **What does the man command do? Type in man rm. How do you scroll and get out? The man command lists the manual for a commandD or Control ⌃-D to advance half a page** **B or Control ⌃-B to go back one page** **U or Control ⌃-U to go back half a page**
- Look at the man page for ls. What does the -l flag do? What does the
- ***a*** flag -do? **The `-l` flag lists files in a list format with more detail and the `-a` lists all files and folders including hidden ones**
- How do you jump between words in the terminal? **option left/right**
- How do you get to the end of a line in terminal? **control + e**
- How do you move your cursor to the beginning in terminal? **control + a**

How do you delete a word (without pressing backspace multiple times) in -terminal? **option + delete**

- What is the difference between a terminal and shell? **The terminal is a program is just an interface to the shell. The shell is what actually handles commands and so forth; the terminal program just gives it a way to interact with the environment.**
- What is an absolute path? **An absolute path is a path that starts from the root route and gives the complete location for a file or folder**
- What is an relative path? **A relative path is a path that starts at the current location and not the root route**
- What is a flag? Give three examples of flags you have used. **A flag adds additional functionality to an existing command, we have seen -a and -l for the ls command and -r for the cp and rm commands**
- What do the r and f flags do with the rm command? **r will remove folders and recursively go through each folder and file and f will force removal**
